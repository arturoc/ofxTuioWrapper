ofxTuioWrapper
==============

[Tuio](http://tuio.org) Wrapper for [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) using ofTouchEvents.


Have a look at tuioExample (client) and mouseToTuioExample (server). run both if you want to see something :) or try the full functionality of the client by using the java based [Tuio Simulator](http://tuio.org/?software) (platform independent).

Dependencies
